# rock_paper_scissors

1. Create function (getComputerChoice) - computer randomly chooses between "Rock" , "Paper" , "Scissors.
2. Create function (playRound) - function should take two parameters (playerSelection , computerSelection) and then returns a string that declares the winner of the round (example - "You Lose! Paper beats Rock.")
    Make playerSelection parameters case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK etc.)
